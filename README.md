Interest in Information Technology

It is hard to answer the question of what my interest is in Information Technology cause it is hard to put it down to one thing specific. I find that Information Technology is the future for most companies are being promoted to being paperfree. It is also unusual to find a household that doesn't have at least one computer in it. If there isnt a computer in the household there are other devices that comensate for there being no computer.

I would say that my interest in Information Technology started when I was very young cause I grew up in the age where we had so much advances in the Information Technology Industry. I began my childhood with Cassette Tapes and 3 ¼ inch Floppy discs. At the end of my childhood we had smartphones and the World Wide Web has branched off, Social Media was still a very distant memory.

DVD were invented midway through my childhood and MP3 players had just hit the market in South Korea. The MP3 Players that were released came before IPODS so they were very small. The MP3 players could only hold 64 MP of music which is about 18 songs at a time.

PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) came before smart phones took over that market and filled that niche with one individual device.

The person that inspired my interest in Information Technology and computers specifically would have to be Willow Rosenberg from the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, She was always doing amasing things and hacking into company databases. When I got older that interest just got stronger with Criminal Minds (Penelope Garcia) and Bones (Angela Montenegro).

Learning new information is always an interest of mine, I have the opinion that you are never too old to learn something new. But I am more interested in where tech is going and wanting to be a part of that.
